# The agent loop

`internal/agent/agent.go` — `Agent.Turn` is the whole idea: append the user
message, stream a completion, run any tool calls, append results, repeat
until the model stops calling tools.

## The cycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Append: Turn(user message)
    Append --> CheckBudget: message stored
    CheckBudget --> Compact: tokens > compactPct of window
    CheckBudget --> Stream: fits
    Compact --> Stream: summary replaces old turns
    Stream --> HasTools: completion finished
    HasTools --> RunTools: tool calls present
    HasTools --> [*]: none — turn over
    RunTools --> Steered: results appended in call order
    Steered --> Append: user typed mid-turn (inject at boundary)
    Steered --> CheckBudget: nothing queued
```

Three properties worth knowing:

1. **Steering injects at loop boundaries only.** `Steer` queues a message;
   it lands between iterations, after tool results are appended — never
   mid-generation. Same mechanism delivers background-subagent reports.
2. **A context-limit error is recoverable.** If the provider rejects a
   request (`context_length_exceeded`, `prompt_too_long`, HTTP 413), the
   loop compacts once and retries. A `compacted` guard prevents retry loops.
3. **The loop is headless.** Events (tokens, tool start/end, compaction)
   flow out through a typed `Events` struct; the TUI is one consumer, tests
   are another. `Events.FanIn` merges subagent event streams.

## Parallel tool calls

When the model emits several tool calls in one turn, `runTools` fans them
out to goroutines. Mutations to the same file serialize through a
per-canonical-path channel lock; everything else runs truly in parallel.
Results land back in **call order**, because the chat API matches tool
results to call IDs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph batch["tool calls in one turn"]
        A["write a.go"]
        B["edit a.go"]
        C["write b.go"]
        D["bash go test ./..."]
    end
    A --> LA["lock: /abs/a.go"] --> R["results ch"]
    B --> LA
    C --> LB["lock: /abs/b.go"] --> R
    D --> LG["global bash lock"] --> R
    R --> O["append in call order"]
```

`bash` takes the global lock because a command's side effects aren't
attributable to one path. Reads don't lock. The why and the Go idiom:
[concurrency.md](concurrency.md).

## Compaction

Context is a budget, and the loop spends it deliberately:

- **Proactive** — `maybeCompact` runs before each request once the latest
  successful request's provider-reported context size (`PromptTokens +
  CompletionTokens`) crosses a percent of the advertised window (default 50%,
  `compactPct` in config, slidable ←/→ in the ctrl+p settings). It is zero
  until the first successful response.
- **Reactive** — a provider context-limit error triggers one compaction +
  retry.

`compact()` keeps the system prompt plus a recent tail, and is
**orphan-safe**: a tail that begins with a `tool`-role message walks back to
its owning assistant message, so no tool result references an erased call ID.

Tool results are structured before this boundary. The summary ledger records
bounded arguments/output, exit status, duration, and artifact metadata; the
derived prompt carries a metadata-only manifest for references cited by the
summary or kept tail. A recent result that exceeds the remaining token budget
is shrunk deterministically without dropping its artifact id, while the raw
SQLite message log remains available for resume, retry, audit, and
`artifact_read`.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph before["conversation before compaction"]
        S[system prompt]
        T1[old turns 1..N]
        T2[recent tail]
    end
    S --> C["compact()"]
    T1 --> SUM["summarize via Complete<br/>(compact model, non-streaming)"]
    T2 --> C
    SUM --> C
    C --> after["system + summary + tail<br/>(tail never orphans a tool call)"]
```

The summarizer defaults to `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`
(`config.DefaultCompactModel`), falls back to the configured
`compactModel`/`compactProvider`, then to the conversation's own model.
`/compact [model] [provider]` does it by hand.

## Background subagents

`task` with `background: true` runs a subagent concurrently and reports back
as a steered message on completion — one channel close wakes the tool
caller, the TUI redraw, and `/tasks` simultaneously. Details:
[concurrency.md](concurrency.md#2-background-subagents--one-channel-close-many-waiters).
